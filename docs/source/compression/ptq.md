## Nvidia PTQ Principle

Operators are the basic building blocks used to define ONNX models. With a rich set of operators, ONNX can describe most DNN and ML models from various frameworks. Functions enable expressing complex operators in terms of more primitive operators. The ONNX specification includes a core set of operators that enable many models. It is a non-goal to add all possible operators, however more operators are added as needed to cover evolving needs.

In this document, we describe the process of accepting a new proposed operator and how to properly submit a new operator as part of ONNX standard. The goal is to improve on what we currently have based on our experience, learning and feedbacks we gathered from the community.
