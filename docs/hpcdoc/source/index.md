The repository mainly provides 2D model inference functionality, and the code provides daily development of packaged libs for integration, testing, and inference. The framework provides multi-threaded, singleton pattern, producer and consumer patterns. Cache log analysis is also supported.


CVDeploy-2D Features:
* Supports real-time caching of runtime log files
* Offers easy integration via a singleton design pattern, providing header files and libraries to encapsulate the algorithm program
* Supports YAML configuration files to set essential parameters for model files
* Compatible with various hardware platforms, including NVIDIA and Qualcomm
* Supports multiple 2D models, such as YOLOv5 and YOLOX
* Integrates multithreading with producer-consumer mode to enable concurrent processing
* Includes user-friendly Bash scripts for one-click installation and execution

Planned Features for CVDeploy-2D:
* Support for model compression techniques, such as quantization.
* Memory leak detection and precision validation for ONNX, TRT, and QNN models.
* Integration of dynamic object detection with geometric tracking algorithms.
